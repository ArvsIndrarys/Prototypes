(documentation in progress)

For this version of this version of the prototype, we have:  
* a Raspberry Pi connected to a battery (= "Node 1" = "consumer")
* a Raspberry Pi connected to a solar panel and a battery (= "Node 2" = "producer")
* a Raspberry Pi controlling a relay, allowing to switch the energy source

(Schema to be added)

On each node (consumer and producer), the CitizenWatt application, Ethereum and the Daisee App are running.
In order to allow for energy exchange, additional python scripts are required:

Clone the repository on each Raspberry Pi:  
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/DAISEE/Scripts.git
```

## Relay

* After connecting the relay to the Raspberry Pi (see the tutorial on [Sunfounder Wiki](http://wiki.sunfounder.cc/index.php?title=4-Channel_High_Level_Trigger_Relay)), connect the node 1 energy source to the first channel (= _channel 0_) and the node 2 energy source to the second channel (= _channel 1_).

* Install RPI.GPIO library:  
```bash
$ pip install RPi.GPIO
```

* Run the following script:
 ```bash
$ python3 scripts/server_relay.py
```

The others nodes can interact with the relay through sockets (port: 15555).
