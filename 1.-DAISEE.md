The main goal of the prototype is to allow peer-to-peer energy exchanges between several nodes of a small-scale network by:
* Collecting and monitoring the Energy consumption/production of the different nodes,
* Triggering Energy exchange according to the predefined rules.

_Proto v0.1_

Several iterations will be done to assess different technologies or hypothesis.

The [first version](https://github.com/DAISEE/Prototypes#prototype-v01) is described [here](https://github.com/DAISEE/UrbanEntrepreneurs/wiki) (documentation in French).  
The current version ([v0.2](https://github.com/DAISEE/Prototypes#prototype-v02)) relies on:
* CitizenWatt application for energy monitoring,
* A local Ethereum blockchain for transactions.  
Each node is composed by a Raspberry Pi 3, an Energy source and a Current sensor. An energy transaction est triggered, when the defined threshold is exceeded.  
  
_Note:_  
The prototype is still in development, some parts may change.
