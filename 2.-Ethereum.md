_(documentation in progress)_  
  
This page describes the setup of a local blockchain (using Parity client) and the DAISEE application on a Raspberry Pi 3.

## Parity installation
An image is available with [Parity](https://github.com/paritytech/parity) and [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) clients:  
➡ http://ethraspbian.com/downloads/image_2017-04-19-EthRaspbian-parity-1.6.6-lite.zip  
(_see repository [diglos/pi-gen](https://github.com/diglos/pi-gen) for more informations_).  
   
This image is compatible with Rapsberry Pi 2 and 3 and runs Parity Ethereum client as a boot service (full Ethereum node).

After turning on the Raspberry Pi, disable the Parity service for now:
```bash
$ sudo systemctl stop parity
$ sudo systemctl disable parity
Removed symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/parity.service.
```

And update/upgrade Raspbian:
```bash
$ sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude upgrade
```

## Parity configuration
Parity can be easily configure through a configuration file:  
➡ https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Configuring-Parity#config-file  
  
For testing purposes and due to ressources limitations, a private/local blockchain will be set up with [Proof-of-Authority](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Proof-of-Authority-Chains) consensus engine, for this version of DAISEE prototype. 
> \[Proof-of-Authority\] does not depend on nodes solving arbitrarily difficult mathematical problems, but instead uses a hard-configured set of "authorities" - nodes that are explicitly allowed to create new blocks and secure the blockchain. This makes it easier to maintain a private chain and keep the block issuers accountable.

All steps for setting up a local blockchain with Proof-of-Authority are described here:  
➡ [Demo PoA tutorial](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Demo-PoA-tutorial)

After following the tutorial, here are the differents files used for one node of the prototype:
* **blockchain specifications** (demo-spec.json):

* **Adding a node**  

Since the blockchain is private/locale, adding a node can be done with the configuration file in **Network** part.
```
[network]
bootnodes = ["enode://ff14ae0a273e08ffbbe20b4b398460eb471e23f1b4301ce46b92a86ad420f67b9b470d097f1939fa7b9b2aae7d24e72cf7c63fe67217bdf3fd6cb60bbb7ecc59@192.168.0.47:30300"]
discovery = false
```
The Public node Node is displayed on Parity Client launch. It can also be found on **Parity UI**, in **Status** tab:  

![](https://framapic.org/hJDm8zBZKEzI/M5RubPw4t5fW)


* In the case where a new validator node is added, after modifying lists of validators, the following message may appear during blocks import:
```
Error: Engine(NotProposer(Mismatch { expected: 00aa39d30f0d20ff03a22ccfc30b7efbfca597c2, found: 00bd138abd70e2f00903268f3db08f2d25677c9e }))
```
The workaround is to modify the chain specifications to revert to the precedent version, until a new error message.  
_Exemple:_ 
![parity client](https://framapic.org/6zUOp85sYvb6/6Jb25HwONahj.png)
_Only 3 blocks are imported with the last version of chain-specs.json (3 validators). In order to import the next blocks, the last validator is removed from chain specs, and blocks are imported until block #55. After this message, using the last version of chain specs (with the 3 validators) allows to import the full blockchain.  
The best solution  would be to add the new validator account only after importing the full blockchain on the node._  


## Smart-contracts

2 smart-contracts (in [Solidity](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html)) are used:
* [token.sol](https://github.com/DAISEE/DApp-v2/blob/master/smartcontracts/token.sol)  
This is the smart-contract described in the tutorial "**[Create your own crypto-currency](https://www.ethereum.org/token)**".  
It allows to create a token, according to the [ERC20 Token Standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20).
* [daisee.sol](https://github.com/DAISEE/DApp-v2/blob/master/smartcontracts/daisee.sol)  
The current version allows to :
    * store energy data on blockchain (consumption and production),
    * make transactions between peers.  
For now, the rules that trigger transactions are not implemented in a smart contract.
Note: the smart contract is still under development, the code may change (see [Issues](https://github.com/DAISEE/DApp-v2/issues)).  

Several methods exist for deploying and testing a smart contract.  
In this wiki, the use of the Parity UI is described.  

### Deploying contracts 
In **Contracts** Tab, after clicking on "DEVELOP" button, paste the smart contract code for the token and compile:
![](https://framapic.org/5MquwR6U5TXh/bnpc8QOIwqhE)  
  
With Parity UI, the smart contract can be easily deployed ("DEPLOY" button):

Deploy the Daisee smart contract:

The two smart-contract now appear in **Contracts** tab:

![](https://framapic.org/A7S6R0ssVjCe/SchLfJXiyiXn)  
  
Note: the current version of DAISEE smart contract allows to update consumption and production directly:

## Interface

To view data, a Web interface communicates with the local node, through [Web3 JavaScript API](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API), using [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js).  
_Tutorial_:  
➡ [A simple smart contract Web UI using web3.js](http://hypernephelist.com/2016/06/21/a-simple-smart-contract-ui-web3.html)  
  
The microframework [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) allows to display the interface from the Raspberry Pi node.  


* clone the repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/DAISEE/DApp-v2.git
```

* create the configuration file (`config.yml`) from the example and complete it:

|Type|Field|Description|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|**contract**|||
| |daisee| Daisee.sol address on the blockchain|
| |token| DaiseeCoin smart-contract address on the blockchain|
|**user**|||
| |login | login for UI |
| |pwd | hashed password for the UI* |
| |coinbase | user address |
| |type | type of node ('C' for consumer, 'P' for producer). _Not Used_ |
| |url | url of energy monitoring application |
| |sensorId | url of energy monitoring application |
| |sensorLogin | login for energy monitoring application |
| |sensorPassword | password energy monitoring application |
| |sensorSource | energy monitoring application  : 'CW' for citizenWatt (only app supported for now) |
| |sensorPort | if necessary, port of energy monitoring application |
> still under development, it may change

_\* to obtain the hashed password, use 'url/hash/\<password>'_


* run the server
```bash
$ export FLASK_APP=server.py
$ python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0
```

> The current version displays Ethereum transactions and realtime data from the energy monitoring application
