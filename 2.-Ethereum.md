_(documentation in progress)_  
This page describes the setup of a local blockchain (using Parity client) and the DAISEE application on a Raspberry Pi 3.

## Parity installation
An image is available with [Parity](https://github.com/paritytech/parity) and [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) clients:  
➡ http://ethraspbian.com/downloads/image_2017-04-19-EthRaspbian-parity-1.6.6-lite.zip  
(_see repository [diglos/pi-gen](https://github.com/diglos/pi-gen) for more informations_).  
   
This image is compatible with Rapsberry Pi 2 and 3 and runs Parity Ethereum client as a boot service (full Ethereum node).

After turning on the Raspberry Pi, disable the Parity service for now:
```bash
$ sudo systemctl stop parity
$ sudo systemctl disable parity
Removed symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/parity.service.
```

And update/upgrade Raspbian:
```bash
$ sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude upgrade
```

## Configuration
Parity can be easily configure through a configuration file:  
➡ https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Configuring-Parity#config-file  
  
For testing purposes and due to ressources limitations, a private/local blockchain will be set up with [Proof-of-Authority](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Proof-of-Authority-Chains) consensus engine, for this version of DAISEE prototype. 
> \[Proof-of-Authority\] does not depend on nodes solving arbitrarily difficult mathematical problems, but instead uses a hard-configured set of "authorities" - nodes that are explicitly allowed to create new blocks and secure the blockchain. This makes it easier to maintain a private chain and keep the block issuers accountable.

All steps for setting up a local blockchain with Proof-of-Authority are described here:  
➡ [Demo PoA tutorial](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Demo-PoA-tutorial)

After following the tutorial, here are the differents files used for one node of the prototype:

* Running Parity  
```bash
$ parity
```
  
![parity](https://framapic.org/gLveyeg1ngIX/Icv7NFuNHYFn.png)  

* In the case where a new validator node is added, after modifying lists of validators, the following message may appear during blocks import:
```
Error: Engine(NotProposer(Mismatch { expected: 00aa39d30f0d20ff03a22ccfc30b7efbfca597c2, found: 00bd138abd70e2f00903268f3db08f2d25677c9e }))
```
The workaround is to modify the chain specifications to revert to the precedent version, until a new error message.  
_Exemple:_ 
![parity client](https://framapic.org/6zUOp85sYvb6/6Jb25HwONahj.png)
_Only 3 blocks are imported with the last version of chain-specs.json (3 validators). In order to import the next blocks, the last validator is removed from chain specs, and blocks are imported until block #55. After this message, using the last version of chain specs (with the 3 validators) allows to import the full blockchain.  
The best solution  would be to add the new validator account only after importing the full blockchain on the node._
